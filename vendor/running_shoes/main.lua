-- Running Shoes
--
-- Hold B and walk faster. Gen 3 gave them to you in the first five minutes;
-- Gen 1 made you wait for a bicycle.
--
-- ------- how it works
--
-- The engine hands a step's duration through the `movement.speed` hook,
-- whose own comment in src/world/Player.lua names running shoes as the
-- reason it exists -- so this mod is the intended shape, not a workaround.
-- A step is a frame count, and lower is faster:
--
--   16  walking, the vanilla number
--    8  bicycle (which is exactly twice walking, hence "doubles")
--
-- The hook is asked for a number and hands one back. Nothing else is
-- touched -- not collision, not the animation, not the step itself -- so a
-- tile still costs a tile and the world does not care how fast you crossed
-- it. This is a duration knob, and duration is the only thing in it.
--
-- ------- the floor
--
-- Steps are counted in whole frames, so the fast end runs out of road: at
-- x4 a step is four frames, and the next multiplier down would be three,
-- then two, then one -- at which point a tile passes in 1/60th of a second
-- and the walk cycle is a strobe. The ladder stops where the animation
-- still reads as walking rather than teleporting.

-- ------- the one place a duration knob is not just a duration
--
-- `movement.speed` is asked on a MANUAL step, and the answer is stored on
-- the player as `stepFramesCur` (src/world/Player.lua). A SCRIPTED step --
-- the guide who walks you to the Poke Mart, Oak marching you to his lab --
-- is not started through `tryMove`: OverworldState:updateScriptMoves sets
-- `moving` and `progress` directly and never touches `stepFramesCur`.
--
-- So a scripted step reuses whatever the last manual step left there.
-- Measured, on a real Player:
--
--     scripted step, no run before it     16 frames
--     scripted step after a running step    8 frames
--
-- The escort NPC has no such knob -- src/world/NPC.lua keeps its own
-- STEP_FRAMES = 16 and never consults this hook -- so the player crosses
-- two tiles for the guide's one, walks out of the scene, and the dialogue
-- fires late against a player who is no longer where the script put him.
--
-- And it happens nearly every time, because the button that advances the
-- dialogue you are being escorted out of is B, which is also the button
-- that makes you run. You mash B, the last step before the cutscene is a
-- running step, and the cutscene inherits it.
--
-- Vanilla leaves 16 there (8 on the bicycle), which is exactly what the
-- NPCs use. So this is ours to clean up: put back what the engine would
-- have left, the moment the player is standing still.

-- ------- what a run leaves behind
--
-- Three opt-in extras, and they are deliberately three separate rows
-- because they are three separate promises:
--
--   RUN FX      a trail behind the player.
--   BURN GRASS  the clod you ran across is CUT, the way CUT cuts it.
--   SAFE GRASS  running through tall grass never starts a battle.
--
-- ------- the cut, and the version of it that was wrong
--
-- The first attempt drew a dark patch over the tile through `render.hud`
-- and called the grass burnt. It was not burnt. It was a shadow lying on
-- grass that was still standing, the grass still had Pokemon in it, and
-- the whole thing hung off one screen-space overlay that had to be right
-- about the camera, the zoom, the dpi and the compositor to show up at
-- all. Every one of those is a way for the feature to be silently absent.
--
-- The engine already knew how to do this. OverworldState:tryCut cuts tall
-- grass by SWAPPING A BLOCK: `field.cutTreeSwaps` is a before/after table
-- of block ids out of the ROM, and cutting writes the "after" id into the
-- map and rebuilds the renderer. So the grass is genuinely gone -- gone
-- from the picture, and gone from `Map:isGrassCell`, which is the exact
-- predicate the wild-encounter check gates on. Nothing is drawn by us,
-- nothing is suppressed, and it cannot fail to be visible, because it is
-- the map.
--
-- One thing has to be better than the engine's own Cut: a block is 2x2
-- cells, so swapping it whole would take four tiles for one footstep. This
-- assembles a block that is the CURRENT block everywhere except the one
-- cell's 2x2 tile quadrant, which comes from the cut one -- a cut exactly
-- one clod wide, built only from tile ids the tileset already has.
--
-- Gold's own CUT is the same kind of whole-block swap, off a different
-- table (`FieldMoves.CUT_BLOCKS`, src/world/gen2/FieldMoves.lua:262) with no
-- tile ids in it at all, only block ids and an animation byte -- so the
-- one-clod trick above runs there too, built from a block DIFF instead of a
-- constant. See "cutting the grass on Gold" further down for the shape of
-- it and why Gold also needs a synthesized COLLISION entry alongside the
-- synthesized tile block, which Gen 1's tile-id walkability never required.
--
-- ------- the trail
--
-- Two layers, and only the second one can fail. The anchor is the ENGINE's
-- own dust puff (`startDustAnim`, the same animation Cut leaves on grass),
-- dropped on the cell just vacated: drawn in the world pass, at the right
-- place under every camera the engine has. On top of it, coloured
-- particles through `render.hud` give dust, flames and bolts their
-- different looks. If that surface is unavailable -- an engine build older
-- than the hook -- the puff is still there and the mod says so in the log.
-- Gold has no `startDustAnim` to borrow (see "what changes on Gold" further
-- down), so there the coloured particles ARE the whole trail -- which is
-- also true the moment this mod runs on an engine build with no
-- `startDustAnim` at all, so nothing about the coloured layer assumes it.
--
-- The overlay's projection rests on one fact about the engine's camera, and
-- it holds in both games because both call the SAME module the same way:
-- `Camera:follow` (src/render/Camera.lua:14) centres on the player with no
-- lerp and no edge clamp, so the player is not somewhere on screen -- he is
-- ALWAYS at the same place. Gen 1's `OverworldController.lua:485` and Gold's
-- `World.lua:9928` both call `camera:follow(p.px, p.py, viewW, viewH)`, and
-- both size that view the same way -- forced to an even width and height, and
-- grown for tilt (`Renderer:worldViewSize`, src/render/Renderer.lua:236, vs
-- `World:draw`, World.lua:9906-9920) -- so the world canvas is blitted
-- centred in the window under either engine, and his cell's top-left corner
-- sits 16 world pixels left of that centre and 8 above it:
--
--     screenX = width/2  - 16*sx + (worldX - player.px) * sx
--     screenY = height/2 -  8*sy + (worldY - player.py) * sy
--
-- ------- SAFE GRASS, and why the dice are still thrown
--
-- The one extra that really is a rule rather than a change to the world.
-- Suppressing by returning nil WITHOUT calling next() would leave the
-- vanilla roll undrawn and shift every later draw off the stream this
-- engine works hard to keep in parity. So a suppressed step calls next()
-- and throws the answer away: it consumes exactly what a vanilla step
-- consumed, and only the battle is missing.

-- is the player's speed times the lifetime -- and pinning the length means
-- deriving the lifetime from the step duration instead of guessing it.

  -- ------- what changes on Gold, and why
  --
  -- The speed crosses over unchanged: src/world/gen2/World.lua:8817 raises
  -- `movement.speed` with the same ctx keys the Gen 1 site offers (and adds
  -- `downhill` and `playerState`, because the Cycling Road already needed
  -- them). Better still, Gold rewrites the base duration from scratch every
  -- step -- World.lua:8787 for walking, :8807 for the bike, both BEFORE the
  -- hook -- so the "put the number back" dance the Gen 1 arm has to do is
  -- not merely unnecessary there, it has nothing to undo.
  --
  -- CUT GRASS and RUN FX used to stand down here too, on the strength of two
  -- claims that turned out to be about the WRONG place to look rather than
  -- about a missing capability:
  --
  --   CUT GRASS   "the swap table has no Gen 2 home" was true of
  --               `data.field.cutTreeSwaps` and beside the point, because
  --               Gold's own CUT does not read that table at all. It reads
  --               `FieldMoves.CUT_BLOCKS` (src/world/gen2/FieldMoves.lua:262),
  --               a per-tileset { facing block -> replacement block,
  --               animation } table, and `World:runCut` (World.lua:5271)
  --               swaps the whole block once the text box closes. That is
  --               reachable from a mod with `engine_internals` (already
  --               declared below) the same way this file already reaches
  --               `mod.world:replaceBlock`, which is `WorldAPI:replaceBlock`
  --               (src/world/gen2/WorldAPI.lua:134) calling straight through
  --               to `World:changeBlock` (World.lua:2014) -- the exact write
  --               `runCut` itself makes. See "cutting the grass on Gold"
  --               below for the one real difference: Gold's grass is not one
  --               tile id the way Red's is, so the one-clod trick has to
  --               diff BLOCKS instead of comparing against a constant.
  --
  --   RUN FX      "measured from the Gen 1 world canvas" was also beside the
  --               point: the projection below never reads anything Gen 1
  --               specific, only `Camera:follow` (src/render/Camera.lua:14)
  --               and the viewport `render.hud` hands over, and Gold's own
  --               `World:draw` (World.lua:9889) calls the SAME
  --               `self.camera:follow(p.px, p.py, vw, vh)` with the SAME
  --               even-size-and-tilt-growth view sizing Gen 1's
  --               `Renderer:worldViewSize` (src/render/Renderer.lua:236)
  --               works out for itself -- one module, one formula, two
  --               callers. What genuinely needed a Gen 2 arm was
  --               `topIsOverworld` below: Gold's overworld is not a stack
  --               state (see the note over it), so the Gen 1 test for "is it
  --               safe to draw" always answered no on a plain walk, which is
  --               what actually stood the trail down, not the projection.
  --
  -- One piece of each honestly does not cross, and both are gated rather
  -- than faked:
  --
  --   * the ENGINE's own dust puff behind a running step
  --     (`OverworldState.startDustAnim`) has no Gen 2 backing at all --
  --     Gold's World never gets a `game.overworld` (Game2.lua has no such
  --     field; WorldAPI.lua:39 reads `game.world` instead) and
  --     `src/world/gen2/World.lua` has no `startDustAnim` method to call.
  --     The `ow and ow.startDustAnim` guards in `world.stepped` below
  --     already answer nil on Gold and skip it; the mod's OWN coloured
  --     particles do not depend on that puff and keep drawing regardless
  --     (see "the puff is not a grass thing" further down).
  --   * an engine build with no `render.hud` call site is still a real gate,
  --     generation or not -- that is the `nohud` warning further down.

  -- there, and the grass still had Pokemon in it because nothing about the
  -- map had changed.
  --
  -- What the engine itself does for CUT is the answer, and it is in
  -- OverworldState:tryCut. Cutting grass is a BLOCK SWAP: `field.cutTreeSwaps`
  -- is a table of before/after block ids extracted from the ROM, and cutting
  -- writes the "after" id into the map and rebuilds the renderer. The grass
  -- is then genuinely gone -- gone from the picture, and gone from
  -- `Map:isGrassCell`, which is what the encounter check reads. No overlay,
  -- no hook, no suppression: the tile simply is not tall grass any more.
  --
  -- One thing has to be better than the engine's own Cut, though, because
  -- of what was asked for: a block is 2x2 cells, so swapping it whole would
  -- cut four tiles for one footstep.
  --
  -- And matching a swap by BLOCK ID has a second problem, which is why the
  -- cut used to skip cells and leave holes down the player's path: the
  -- swap table only names the specific blocks CUT was ever meant to be
  -- used on. Run across a grass block that is not in it and there was no
  -- pair to take tiles from, so nothing happened and the trail broke.
  --
  -- So the swap table is read for ONE thing instead: which tile the grass
  -- becomes. Compare any before/after pair tile by tile, and wherever the
  -- before is grass and the after is not, the after is the ground the
  -- grass was standing on. With that single tile id, ANY block can be cut,
  -- one cell at a time, by replacing just that cell's grass tiles -- so
  -- every cell the player runs over is cut and the trail is unbroken.

  -- FACING in `FieldMoves.CUT_BLOCKS` (:262), a per-tileset { before block ->
  -- after block, animation } table transcribed from
  -- data/collision/field_move_blocks.asm, and `World:runCut` (World.lua:5271)
  -- swaps the WHOLE 32x32 block for the "after" one once the text box
  -- closes. That is the same "four tiles for one footstep" problem BURN
  -- GRASS exists to fix on Gen 1 -- so the same one-clod trick applies, on
  -- different raw material.
  --
  -- `CUT_BLOCKS` never names a tile id, only two BLOCK ids and an animation
  -- byte -- 1 for the grass swirl, 0 for the falling tree (World.lua:260-261)

  -- OVERWORLD tileset allows. Instead, every GRASS row (animation 1) in a
  -- tileset's table has its "before" and "after" 16-tile blocks diffed
  -- against each other, and every position that changed becomes one entry
  -- in a SOURCE TILE -> DEST TILE table -- Gen 1's single substitution,
  -- generalised to however many distinct grass tiles Gold's edge and corner
  -- art actually uses.

  -- -- a table built in lockstep with `tileset.blocks` off the same
  -- METATILE_COUNT loop (src/import/RomExtractorGen2.lua:803-820), so a
  -- synthesized block needs a synthesized collision QUAD at the same new id
  -- or the cut cell reads back as impassable rather than as plain ground.

  -- ------- running under a camera that took the walk away
  --
  -- The Dramatic Shape voxel mod's 1ST and 3RD rungs do not walk the grid.
  -- Its `lib/FreeMove.lua` wraps `OverworldState:handleInput` and, while a
  -- free camera drives, replaces the walk outright with a continuous
  -- camera-relative one: a point in world pixels advanced by `FreeMove.WALK`
  -- (1.0) or `FreeMove.BIKE` (2.0) pixels a frame, with the player's logical
  -- cell kept honest and `OverworldState:onStepComplete` fired once per cell
  -- crossed -- so warps, encounters and step counters all still happen.
  --
  -- What does NOT happen is `movement.speed`. There is no step duration to
  -- ask about, because there is no step: the hook this whole mod is built on
  -- is never called while that camera is up. And it is not only the speed
  -- that goes with it -- CUT GRASS, SAFE GRASS and the trail all read
  -- `running`, and `movement.speed` is the only thing that ever sets it. So
  -- every row of the mod went quiet the moment the camera came off the
  -- ceiling, silently and with nothing in the log. That is issue #1.
  --
  -- The fix has to be paid in the currency the free walk deals in, and it
  -- converts exactly: sixteen frames for a sixteen-pixel cell IS one pixel a
  -- frame, which is why `FreeMove.WALK` is 1.0 in the first place. Dividing
  -- a step duration by f and multiplying a walk speed by f are the same
  -- sentence, and the floor is the same floor -- `MIN_FRAMES` frames per
  -- cell is 16/`MIN_FRAMES` pixels a frame -- so the ladder, the bike and
  -- surf gates, and the point at which the animation stops reading as
  -- walking are all the numbers the grid arm already argues for above.
  --
  -- The seam into that mod is its own front door: it publishes its module
  -- namespace as `mod.exports.lib` so that "a companion mod can pin its own
  -- tiles' shapes or read the camera without reaching into this mod's file
  -- layout", and `mod.find` (src/mods/Loader.lua:1071) is the engine's way
  -- to reach it -- a handle or nil, never a hard dependency.
  --
  -- Wrapping `FreeMove.tick` is NOT a front door, and is declared as what it
  -- is: a monkeypatch, the third rung of the ladder. It is confined to one
  -- call -- set the two constants, run the original, put them back whatever
  -- happened -- so if that module is ever restructured the failure mode is
  -- that running stops working inside the voxel camera, which is precisely
  -- where it stands today. Nothing else in this file depends on it.
  --
  -- One thing genuinely does not come back, and is not faked: RUN FX. The
  -- trail is a screen-space overlay measured off `Camera:follow`, and
  -- `flatWorld` above already stands it down whenever a render pipeline owns
  -- the world pass -- which the voxel pipeline does, at every rung including
  -- the overhead ones. A 2D overlay cannot follow a depth-buffered camera,
  -- and drawing it anyway would put the trail somewhere the player is not.
